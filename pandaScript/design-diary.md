#### Design Diary -- Pandas --


    I think I am a slow learner, have trouble focusing or part time 
working at a grocery store leaves me mentally drained for me
to get into these assignments. I normally don't like to touch the diary
until I have completed the assignment so I can capture all of my
struggles but this one I wasn't even to accomplish the bare minimum.
When we were going over pandas, I was still stuck on the previous 
assignment but got the bare minimum to work on that last assignment.
I first started out Pandas confused because I was thinking about
python and python libraries and didn't even realize that Pandas
itself was a library and not background code for jupyter notebook
to work. I started working with matricies in python making my life
more difficult than it should be. The documentations online were
honestly overwhelming because I didn't wanna spend all day
reading the extra features so it was discouraging to look up
more sites and small length videos to figure out what code snippets
I would run into inconsistencies in tutorials. I spent too much time
thinking if I should save my altered dataframe into a CSV
or copy it into another dataframe, turns out it doesn't matter here.
 I started over a
couple of times, there are at least 5 attempts. I then decided to
watch two 1-hour youtube videos about Pandas from a guy named
"Keith Galli" who uses panda in normal scenerios. After watching
these videos I became more familiarzed with the functions that
Pandas offered, but the familiarity took me a couple of days 
to sink in. I spent a lot of time in my head thinking
what are some valid questions I could ask the data but
statistics and math were escaping me. So I had to review
the concept of linear regression, correlation which took me
another day. I feel like professors are yearly engaged in
academia so when they write instrutions or speak of 
instructions, they are said in a concise and compact way
and a lot of abstract detail is stripped away and I
juggle from topics to topics. I didn't even realize the minimum
requirements for the pandas assignment and when I checked
in with my buddies, they didn't even realize this, I have
a bad habit of checking in with the professors repository.
This is my first semester delving into visual studios code
and had a slow start but I appreciate all of it's functionalities
as I use it a lot for web apps. Back to Pandas, my mind couldn't
capture my goals until I wrote it down, this provided an echo
in my quarantine times. I was able to figure out what I wanted
my independant and dependant variables to be and how to solve
for linear regression and found pandas function. I was 
more pandas oriented more days later. I got stuck a lot, I found 3 
ways I could plot data and only 1 way worked, this was frustrating
cause this meant I had to research the data. I have to admit,
I feel the most behind in this class out of my 4 classes and I have
honestly dumped the most thinking into this one but the gains
are just not ideal. I like the exposure because when I find something
I really wanna use python for I am sure I will have some sort of 
head st art. Anyways I got stuck where I was able to plot Post test
% scores and Class Test % Score but the Class Test %'s were not
sorted. First the column's were strings, so I
converted them into type float. Then I sorted using df.sort_values(by=['columnx']) but nothing happened,
I felt like stripping numbers to a list and then
sorting and then replacing the values back while acknowleding their
index seemed like an uncessary solution.
I haven't even started on the QT stuff but this class is hard without 
asking for help that's not the internet.  I am trying not to get 
too distracted but this 'rona virus 2020 keeps being a daily focus now-a-days.
